## Who am I?
My name is **Thomas Weitzel**.
When people have trouble pronouncing my last name, I suggest to try _White Cell_.
If you want to call me by my nickname, that's fine, too.
It is **Thomy**, pronounced like _Tommy_.

I work as an independent software developer since more than twenty years.
Industries I've worked in include Finance, Health Care, Automotive, Military, and Government.
Mostly I worked on internal projects, but also some software products.
My mother tongue is German.

## What's the topic?
This blog covers my findings while exploring various aspects of programming in general, with a special focus on functional programming.

## The motivation?
Why do people climb mountains?
British mountaineer George Mallory famously answered: *Because they're there*.
They want to reach the top faster, in a more efficient or elegant way, differently than anybody else, or even at all.
That's how you approach problem-solving in programming.

## What to expect
Since I'm coming from an object-oriented background, expect all sorts of problems I'm stumbling into and then getting out of.
C, C++, and Java were my first professionally used programming languages.
Later I switched to Scala, and even later to Kotlin.
I had, and still have, a lot to learn, even more to unlearn, and I'm not nearly done yet.
If you're having a similar background, maybe you can get something out of my mistakes and the occasional success.

## _Do, or not do. There is no try_. &ndash; Yoda
The decision is not between doing something or not.
It's that *trying* is something more than just any attempt.
