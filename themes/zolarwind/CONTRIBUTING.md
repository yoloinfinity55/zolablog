## Handling Stale Issues

To keep the repository organized and manageable, I have implemented a process for handling stale issues. Here's how it works:

1. **Inactivity Period**: Issues that have not had any activity for 30 days will be automatically marked as stale.
2. **Stale Label**: A "stale" label will be added to these issues.
3. **Notification**: A comment will be posted on the issue, notifying the user that the issue is marked as stale and will be closed if no further activity occurs.
    ```markdown
    This issue has been automatically marked as stale due to inactivity.
    If this is still a problem, please provide an update.
    Otherwise, this issue will be closed in 7 days.
    Thank you!
    ```
4. **Closing Stale Issues**: If there is no response within 7 days after being marked as stale, the issue will be automatically closed with a final comment.
    ```markdown
    This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
    If you still need help, please feel free to reopen it.
    Thank you!
    ```
5. **Reopening Closed Issues**: Closed issues can be reopened if needed. Leave a comment explaining why the issue should be reopened.
